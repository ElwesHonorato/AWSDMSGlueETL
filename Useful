Walkthrough: Refer to resource outputs in another AWS CloudFormation stack
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/walkthrough-crossstackref.html
To export resources from one AWS CloudFormation stack to another, create a cross-stack reference. Cross-stack references let you use a layered or service-oriented architecture. 
Instead of including all resources in a single stack, you create related AWS resources in separate stacks; then you can refer to required resource outputs from other stacks. 
By restricting cross-stack references to outputs, you control the parts of a stack that are referenced by other stacks.
