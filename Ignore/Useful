Walkthrough: Refer to resource outputs in another AWS CloudFormation stack
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/walkthrough-crossstackref.html
To export resources from one AWS CloudFormation stack to another, create a cross-stack reference. Cross-stack references let you use a layered or service-oriented architecture. 
Instead of including all resources in a single stack, you create related AWS resources in separate stacks; then you can refer to required resource outputs from other stacks. 
By restricting cross-stack references to outputs, you control the parts of a stack that are referenced by other stacks.

Redshift connections
    https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/aws-glue-programming-etl-connect-redshift-home.html
    Your Amazon Redshift cluster needs to be able to read and write to Amazon S3 in order to integrate with AWS Glue jobs.
    To allow this, you can associate IAM roles with the Amazon Redshift cluster you want to connect to. 
    Your role should have a policy allowing read from and write to your Amazon S3 temporary directory. 
    Your role should have a trust relationship allowing the redshift.amazonaws.com service to AssumeRole.
